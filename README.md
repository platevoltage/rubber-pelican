# rubber-pelican

The goal of this device is to be functionally equivalent to the USB rubberDucky by Hak5. Unlike the rubber ducky, the payload is interpreted by a built in duckyscript interpreter and doesn't require compilation. Furthermore, payloads can be run from a web interface. To run this project, open it up with VSCode with the PlatformIO extension, and upload to an ESP32S2 device (native USB required).
